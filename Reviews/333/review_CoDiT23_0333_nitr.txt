Review of

Towards an ontology-based fault detection and
diagnosis framework - a semantic approach


*****************************************************************

The paper deals with an approach of fault detection in continuously
changing systems by combining several fault detection approaches with
the help of semantic technologies.

The paper gives a good overview of those techniques and can serve as a
guide line which combination is best for which issue.

First a brief overview for ontology-based reasoning and some relevant
semantic technologies are given.

FTA corresponds here to RCA ??

Figure 2 gives a good overview of the approach and the workflow is
well explained int Ch. II.
Which also includes a feedback loop
How does Fig. 3 fits into Fig. 2 - this is not really clear, is it?
 
Well structured paper, starting with the defintion of methods (and
introducing the used abbrevations).



Concerns:
********
The approach seems to be very complex, (too) many aspects are
considered (e.g. six ontology parts, ....). Is this complexity
applicable already in a first stage at once?
Or is this just a proposal...
