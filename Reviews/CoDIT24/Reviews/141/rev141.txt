Commonly Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs) are employed
extensively as voltage regulators and VAR compensators in transmission
networks in power systems.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A lot of abbreviations not explained already in the abstracts: e.g.:

PV-STATCOM: Photovoltaic Static Synchronous Compensator (PV-STATCOM)

PCC
point of common coupling (PCC)

THD total harmonic distortion (THD)

Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS)
From the Internet:
FACTS devices are static power-electronic devices installed in AC
transmission networks to increase power transfer capability,
stability, and controllability of the networks through series and/or
shunt compensation.

II.A) Fault-tolerant approach...
What is CTD?

II.B) Figure 1: axis notations in englisch letters and what is U[p.u.], Unit??
      Figure 2: notations in french....

II.C) Next abbreviations: TCSC, SSSC and UPFC’s [14] - makes it hard to read and understand.

D) What is MPPT control? It is also referred to [17] and then cited the next abbreviation.

THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING!!

The controller block diagramm is not so clear. It is more a screen
shot from the Simulink model than a kind of an abstract block diagram
for explanatory purposes.


III: Simulation Results
III:A: Full STATCOM mode
Poor description / interpretation of the behaviour and also of the figures.
- Figure 6 & 7 & 8: no physical units at the axis!
- Figure 6:  no legend....
- What is the difference between Fig. 7 and 8, the configuration (inductive, capacitive) ? 

=> STATCOM in full mode works correctly in both configurations
(inductive, capacitive).  However, how was the plant modelled in the
simulink model to provide a feasible model to interpret the control
performance.


III.B: PV-STATCOM mode
Last sentence on page 4:

...the power factor is initially at 0.75 and the PV STATCOM mode is
enabled between t=5s and t=8s.
=> should be .... t=0.5s and t=0.8s.

The same holds for the description of Fig. 10 and 11: the activation
of the STATCOM mode should be at 0.5s, for my understanding.

Please avoid 'see figure below', but use \ref{} in LaTeX.


IV: Conclusion
good conclusion, but very short.

Overall, the simulation results are not really pretty well analyzed
nor documented, starting with the captions of the figures for the
simulation results and the axis description (e.g. no physical units)
