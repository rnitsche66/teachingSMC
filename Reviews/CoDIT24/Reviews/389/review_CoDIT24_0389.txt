I know that "C-u 80 C-x f" sets the fill width 80, and M-q
adjusts it. How to make it default? I mean, how to make
width 80 deafault for fill width?

In your .emacs place (setq-default fill-column 80) Or you
can just use M-x customize-variable on fill-column, and it
will set it and save it for you using the standard customize
interface

fill-column is a buffer-local variable, which is why you
need setq-default, not just setq.

Dynamic Hard Shoulder Running Lane Control

"This paper aims to devise a novel and practical switching
policy for efficient dynamic HSR lane control. It is based
on properties of the triangular (piecewise linear)
fundamental diagram and relies on real-time measurements of
density only, or its proxies, such as occupancy and speed."

Note: paper currently too long 8pages

To Editors only

This paper endeavours to develop an innovative and
feasible switching strategy for optimizing dynamic hard
shoulder running (HSR) lane control. Drawing upon the
characteristics of the triangular fundamental diagram
(FD), a piecewise linear model, the approach utilizes
real-time density measurements or their proxies, such
as occupancy and speed.

This approach seems to be very applicable since it fits
some requirements (hysteresis switching, less
measurement information, robustness issues, ...) to be
applied to real world scenarios.

Cool approach for robust control strategies in using
the HSR lane. Not so many applied research can be found
on this topic.

The discussion and analysis of the control performance
of the proposed concept is based on the kinematic wave
theory.


However, the paper is currently too long (8 pages) and
it has to be shortened somehow. Maybe the authors
should try to focus on the most important, new, and
challenging issues of this approach.




To the author:

For what is the flow/density diagram good for (Fig.6c)
?  If Fig 6 is referred, please add also which
subfigure is meant, e.g. Fig.6c.

The proposed concept is compared to the performance of
the approach in [23].  It would be helpful for the
interpretation / comparison of the results if the
reader has an idea of what is the concept of the
control stragety in [23]. Maybe more than this is an
ad-hoc strategy.
