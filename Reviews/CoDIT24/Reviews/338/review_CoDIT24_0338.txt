I know that "C-u 80 C-x f" sets the fill width 80, and M-q
adjusts it. How to make it default? I mean, how to make
width 80 deafault for fill width?

Manipulability analysis to improve the performance of a
7-DoF serial manipulator

Ali Kanso, Marco Schneider, Rainer Müller


This paper conducts a kinematic analysis of a 7-DoF manipulator,
addressing the inverse kinematic problem and discussing
a method for optimizing the robot configuration.

As the robot configuration has 7 degrees of fredoom, the
system is redundant and has the possibility to reach a given
point in the working space by severeal configurations.

The DH notation is used to describe the kinematics.

This paper introduces an  interessting approach to adapt the
configuration  for  a  given  trajectory. This  is  done  by
minimizing  the  inaccuracies  in the  force  estimation  by
ensuring that the condition number of the Jacobian matrix is
as  low  as  possible.  Note,  that  the  redundancy  angle
(delta_3,2) is kept constant during motion.

This is an interesting approach. It would be helpful if a
kind of flow diagram for the necessary computations is added
to get a better understanding what has to be computed.

Some questions arises, while reading the paper.  Maybe the
authors can taker them into account in the final iteration
step of the paper.


To the author:


Manipulatility is not properly explained....  Do we need to
calculate the optimal static joint angle of the redundant
joint for every trajectory?

A flow diagram would be helpful to understand the
computional tasks better. Which computation leads to which
decision and one finally comes up with the best (optimal)
configuration for this trajectory.


What exactly is changed in the configuration of the iiwar
robot after the optimization? At which value was the
redundancy angle (delta_3,2) before and after the
optimization?

The best configuration depends on a given trajectory, right?
So the optimization has to be done after teaching or
trajectory planning - is that right?

Typos / suggestions:

The dimension of (2) is not so clear. As a consequence, the
sentence after the introduction of (2), that is 'The vector
composed ...' is hard to understand.

Page 4: what do you exactly mean with 'isotropic behaviour'?

Fig always with capital letters.
Use (2) for referencing to eq. not equation 2
Use \sin , \cos for mathematical funstions in LaTeX
Use a dot or a semicolon after an equations -> makes the
paper easier to read
