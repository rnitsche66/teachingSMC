I know that "C-u 80 C-x f" sets the fill width 80, and M-q
adjusts it. How to make it default? I mean, how to make
width 80 deafault for fill width?

In your .emacs place (setq-default fill-column 80) Or you
can just use M-x customize-variable on fill-column, and it
will set it and save it for you using the standard customize
interface

fill-column is a buffer-local variable, which is why you
need setq-default, not just setq.

Modeling and simulation of mechatronics equipment for a Digital
Twin-enabled demonstrator

Abstract:
*********


To Editors only
***************

The focus of this paper is to derive a model of a transfer
line with mechatronic equipment. The goal of this
behavior-model is to simulate an assembly line. For this
model a commercial tool, i.e. iPhysics is
used. Furhtermore, the idea of a Digital-Twin (DT)
framework is presented, where the structure for data
exchange is presented.  The The special feature of the
proposed designed system lies in the simultaneous
distribution of tasks to both physical environment and its
virtual counterpart.

No simulation results nor any model validation results are
presented.

The paper is well written and clearly structured.  But
what is new in this research?  What is the scientific part
of this paper?

The paper seems to be more a paper of the category "work
in progress".  The paper also only have 4 pages, so it may
also fit to the paper category "work in progress".



To the author:
*************

The paper is well written and clearly structured. However,
some questions arises while reading the paper:

As a Digital Twin is so multifaceted, it makes sense to
firstly what is understood when talking about a DT.

What are the scientific aspects of this work, what is new?
This should be highlighted more.

How is the interface to easy and quickly import the data
of the system components in the DM of iPhysics? Importing
the data manually is not really an option, or?

How does the physical layer looks like? This should be
described in a little more detail
