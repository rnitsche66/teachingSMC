I know that "C-u 80 C-x f" sets the fill width 80, and M-q
adjusts it. How to make it default? I mean, how to make
width 80 deafault for fill width?

In your .emacs place (setq-default fill-column 80) Or you
can just use M-x customize-variable on fill-column, and it
will set it and save it for you using the standard customize
interface

fill-column is a buffer-local variable, which is why you
need setq-default, not just setq.

Modeling and simulation of mechatronics equipment for a Digital
Twin-enabled demonstrator

Abstract:
*********


To Editors only
***************

The focus of this paper is to derive a model of a transfer
line with mechatronic equipment. The goal of this
behavior-model is to simulate a assembly line. For this
model a commercial tool, i.e. iPhysics is
used. Furhtermore, the idea of a Digital-Twin (DT)
framework is presented, where the structure for data
exchange is presented.  No simulation results nor any
model validation results are presented.

The paper is well written and clearly structured.  But
what is new in this research?  What is the scientific part
of this paper?

The paper seems to be more a paper of the category "work
in progress".  The paper also only have 4 pages, so it may
also fit to the paper category "work in progress".

What is the scientific research?
What is new in this paper?

How is the link to the development department or manufacturer to
easily adapt the needed data for the DM and to validate the model.

How is the interface to easy and quickly import the data of the system
components in the DM of iPhysics? Importing the data manually is not
really an option, or?



As a Digital Twin is so multifaceted, it makes sense to firstly what
is understood when talking about a DT.

What is the goal of the the DT approach? Optimizing the process with respect to time?
