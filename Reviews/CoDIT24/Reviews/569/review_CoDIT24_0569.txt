I know that "C-u 80 C-x f" sets the fill width 80, and M-q
adjusts it. How to make it default? I mean, how to make
width 80 deafault for fill width?

In your .emacs place (setq-default fill-column 80) Or you
can just use M-x customize-variable on fill-column, and it
will set it and save it for you using the standard customize
interface

fill-column is a buffer-local variable, which is why you
need setq-default, not just setq.

To Editors only

The control design objective is to regulate the server temperature for
some even scenarios that could happen in real DC center operation,
while at the same time minimizing the cooling power consumption.

The goal of the control design is to keep the temperature of a
contained data center (DC) under several disturbances (server load,
ambient temperature variations) at a desired quasi-constant value. The
control strategie has to consider power consumption of the cooling
system and temperature ranges for the devices in the control loop. For
this a linear time discrete Model Predictive Control (MPC) Strategy is
proposed.

Simulation studies for various real-world scenarios are presented.

Model is linaer and for the MPC approach in time discrete manner.
Note, all states are assumed to be measurable!
Q and R are the tuning variables.

All in all the control performance is quite good and the limits are
are not violated at any time.

The control strategy is well explained and the paper is clearly
structured.

The simulation results could be discussed and analyzed a little bit
more. For example: What happens if the wighting factors Q and R are
changed.  Why is the reaction of the controlled system in Fig.6 for
the same disturbance at 5ooo sec and 35ooo sec in steady state mode
not the same?

It is a solid conference paper and can be accepted.  Some suggestions
for better readability and to improve the paper a little can be found
in the section for the authors.



To the author:

In (2) p(t) is considered as a disturbance - right? How does the MPC
approach takes this disturbance into account? Since p(t) containes the
room temperature and server power this two elements are easily
measurable and can be included as known but time variant parameters.


In Fig. 3 Ts,umin and Ts,umax is also depicted put not explained nor
analyzed. 

In Scenario II, the server power P_s changes due to some special
effects. Is the server power measured and taken into account in the
model as a time variant parameter? This is not really clear.

Why is the reaction of the temperature in Fig.6 (Scenario II) at 3.000
sec and at 35.000 sec not in the same direction? At both times the
system is in steady state at ~52°C and a disturbance of server power
consum occures but the temperature tends not in the same direction at
both times.
