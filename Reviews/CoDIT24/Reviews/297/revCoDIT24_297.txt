Simulator of the Spatial Location of the Knee Axis of Rotation During
Flexion

only 4 pages...

TO EDITOR:
A knee simulator (mechanical construction) is introduced, which allows
not only bending in the direction of walking but also in the
perpendicular directions of walking directions ("O-legs" and "X-legs").

What is currently available in the market? What is the state of the art.
For what is this work (it's not really a research) good for?
Is the model really valid?




TO AUTHOR:

Figure 1: corresponds to which citation [11], [12] or [13]

Figure 3: you should name the rubber washers in one of the pictures a)-c)

III.C: the movement of the mechanism should be illustrated with
another picture where all importand parts are seen.

III.D: Figure 4: Which rod and which joint corresponds to that one in
Fig. 2 and or 4 ?

The description of Fig. 4 is not so clear, as well as the labeling of
the drawing in Fig. 4.
Which plane do we see in Fig. 4.

What is the result of the analysis? For what do we need this analysis?

III.E: a simple bill of material as a table would be more clear, than
listing the parts in a text field.
