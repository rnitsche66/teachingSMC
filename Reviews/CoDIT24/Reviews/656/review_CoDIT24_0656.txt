I know that "C-u 80 C-x f" sets the fill width 80, and M-q
adjusts it. How to make it default? I mean, how to make
width 80 deafault for fill width?

In your .emacs place (setq-default fill-column 80) Or you
can just use M-x customize-variable on fill-column, and it
will set it and save it for you using the standard customize
interface

fill-column is a buffer-local variable, which is why you
need setq-default, not just setq.

Lumped-Parameter Modeling: Enabling Real-Time Battery Management

Mehrdad Babazadeh and W. Dhammika Widanage


Abstract:
*********

A lumped parameter approach for Li-ion batteries is used
to identify the so-called key parameters (sensitive
parameters?)

The approach to identify the sensitive (?) parameters of
the LPTM is designed to be computed in
real-time. Furhtermore the algorithm is designed to be
robust in the sense of accuracy and reliability for
several operational scenarios.

The focus of the paper is an online parameter estimation
algorithm. Several measures have been applied to improve
the robustness and accuracy of the parameter estimation
algorithm. The effects or impact of the particular
measures are summarized in a table.

However, it is almost unclear, how the measueres are
derived and implemented in the final algorithm. There is
too much information in the paper, which is not very well
structured and explanations are incomplete.

Futhermore, the equations are inconsistend, not well
structured, Figures are not explained at all and parameter
values are without physical units.
And the paper is too long (8 pages).

To the Editors only:
********************
I recommand to reject the paper. It should be completely
restructured and rerewritten.

To the Authors, addidionally:
*****************************

Very interesting and well structured overview of the
state-of-the-art of SoH monitoring of Li-ion
batteries. Maybe a little bit too long.

Data normilization (Sec. III.D) makes sense for
computations and is always a good idea to increase
robustness in the sense of robust stability. => good
idea!!

The following questions and remarks arises while
reading the paper:

Are the above mentioned key paramteres the sensitive
parameters of the model and thus therefore suitable /
necessary to be identified online?

A lot of abbreviations are used throghout the
paper. Maybe a table with most importand / used
abbreviations is useful.

Text in the equation is not properly formated:
e.g. in (1) - kvl => \mathrm
     (7): where also in mathrm
This makes the paper easier to read.  

If the temperature is modelled as Arrhenius type this is
non-linear. How can convergence be ensured for the LSM?
However, I didn't find the Arrhenius type anywhere in the
text.

In (10): unity mismatch: s T_s - T_s(0) !! s is the
Laplace variable [1/sec], one cannot substract these two
variables due to a unity mismatch?



For (11) - (14) use subequations => easier to read. And
please try to present the equations in a more compact and
proper way.
E.g. \Phi^T in (13) has another dimension as in (17) ....


What are the equations for the ECM in the continuous
case and in the time discrete case? Please take care of
a proper description to understand what is how
computed.

Fig. 2 is not a Figure, it is more a Table.  But the
parameters in the table have no units! ?

The equations are numbered, but in the text these
reference to the equation numbers are rarely used. This
makes the paper very hard to understand.

Fig. 4 to Fig. 9 are not explained or analyzed at all!

For the parameters in the text and in the equations no physical units
are used at all!!!!


The report should be completely revised to improve
readability and comprehensibility. The approach is
certainly cool, but unfortunately the benefits and the
scientific aspect are not highlighted enough.



Introduction:
*************



Main Contribution:
*****************

A new procedure (wie auch immer die aussieht) is
introduced by redesigning a lumped parameter model to have
a robust and reliable solution for identifying the
critical / sensitive parameters.


Aber wie der Ansatz ist wird hier noch nicht verraten. Ziemlich
allgemein.


Abbreviations:
- lumped parameter thermal models (LPTM)
- battery management system (BMS)
- batteryâ€™s state of health (SoH)
- simplified refined instrumental variable (SRIVC)
- Limited Memory Recursive Least Squares
  Algorithm with Variable Forgetting Factor (VFF-LMRLS)
- Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) - to late defined
- Thermally Coupled Equivalent Circuit Model (TECM)

Maybe a list of the most importand and often used
abbreviations is helpful.

T_s means T in the Laplace domain
T_f: ambient Temperature
T: Sampling Time
T_v: Sampling Time of the discretized ECM (with Tustin)

Redaktionel eher schlecht:

Which is the ECM in the continuous case and in the time
discrete case? Please take care of a proper description to
understand what is how computed.

Fig. 2 is not a Figure, it is more a Table.
But the parameters in the table have no units! ?

The equations are numerized, but in the text these
reference to the equation number are rarely used. This
makes the paper very hard to understand or even
impossible.

Data normilization (Sec. III.D) makes sense and is always
a good idea to increase robustness in the sense of robust
stability. => good idea!!

The pseudo code (Algorithm 1) helps a little in
understanding what is implemented and computed.

Fig. 4 to Fig. 9 are not explained or analyzed at all!

LPTM used for BMS and SoH.

The paper should be overworked completely to improve
readability and to better analyze what is the benefit of
this approach. I think the the takeled task is really
cool, but it is really hard to understand what are the key
benefits of this approach.


For the parameters in the text and in the equations no physical units
are used at all!!!!
