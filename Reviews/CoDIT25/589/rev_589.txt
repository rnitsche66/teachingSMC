AI-Assistant: Summary Consultant

The text discusses the design and experimental testing of a
fault-tolerant electromechanical actuator (EMA) for heavy unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs). The architecture features a dual coaxial
electric motor and a harmonic drive gearbox, which enhances the
actuator 's resilience and performance under various operating
conditions. The system operates in three modes: nominal, fail
operational, and fail safe, ensuring continuous functionality even
after a failure. The health monitoring system includes multiple
monitoring units that detect faults and improve diagnostic
capabilities. The actuator meets stringent requirements for safety and
reliability, making it suitable for critical aviation applications
(page 2, page 3, page 5).
