The text discusses the design and experimental testing of a
fault-tolerant electromechanical actuator (EMA) for heavy unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs). The architecture features a dual coaxial
electric motor and a harmonic drive gearbox, which enhances the
actuator's resilience and performance under various operating
conditions. The system operates in three modes: nominal, fail
operational, and fail safe, ensuring continuous functionality even
after a failure. The health monitoring system includes multiple
monitoring units that detect faults and improve diagnostic
capabilities. The actuator meets stringent requirements for safety and
reliability, making it suitable for critical aviation applications
(page 2, page 3, page 5).

Interesting architecture for safety applications with some new
aspects. The proposed concept can be used in many other application
fields, especially in the field of cooperative robotics.

Paper is well-written and clearly structured.

This paper is more to show the applicability of the concept for
fault-tolerant electromechanical actuators.  The focus of this paper
is the application rather than the scientific approach.

However it is a solid conference paper.

Some questions to be considered:

- How to choose the treshold of the fault latency to assure robust
- behavior?  In the keynote it is noted that the approach consists a
- model-based fault detection algorithm. Can you describe the basic
- ideas of the key algrithms (i.e. controller, fault-detection, ....)
- to have an idea how those core features are treated.
