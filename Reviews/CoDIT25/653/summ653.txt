## Abstract: The paper presents a fault estimation and control
strategy for nonlinear Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems with
variable delays. It introduces a sliding-mode observer to estimate
system states and actuator faults robustly, complemented by an
adaptive sliding-mode controller to dynamically mitigate faults and
uncertainties. The architecture emphasizes modularity for flexibility
and scalability, ensuring improved fault detection, robust
performance, and stability despite challenges such as time-varying
delays and nonlinearities. Simulation results validate the proposed
approach's effectiveness compared to existing methods.

## Key Concepts:
- **Delayed LPV Systems**: These systems face complexities such as actuator degradation and sensor failures, necessitating robust fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategies.
- **Active Fault-Tolerant Control (AFTC)**: Enhances system adaptability and reliability by dynamically reconfiguring control actions post-fault detection.
- **Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI)**: Accurate FDI methods are crucial for optimizing FTC performance.
