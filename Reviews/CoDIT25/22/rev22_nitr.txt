Dementia Diagnosis

Short Summary

also economical impact

Key Issues: *******************************************************
hands on data analysis:
1) Chi Square method and then (determine whether there is dependency)

2) Cramers V (Kind of correlation): what's the value of the dependency
/ correlation

This is not a scientific contribution and has nothing to do with
engineering in a technical sense which is supposed to be the scope of
CoDIT.

Again: unusual formating
The caption Figure 1 and Figure 2 should be under the figures, not
above. For the tables it's ok. For Figure 3 it is ok.

An Error message appears in the text from the type setting system ->
paper not carefully prepared.

Improvements / Questions ********************************************
- a lot of abbreciaitons are used before explanation (hard to read) =>
not really :) contrerily - a lot of abbreviations introduced and never
used, e.g  VHA,
and some abbreviations are explained twice, (MCI) ...
   
- What is the scientific part of the papaer?

Data (NHIS) preprocessing is hard to understand as it is in Fließtext....
Not structured some how -> is there a method behind the preprocessing ...
seems to be taylor-made - again scientific method is not available

use brackets when referring to equations e.g. Equation (1) not Equation 1.

The explanation of the Chi-square method is ok. :)


To the Editors: Does this topic really matches to the CoDIT issues?
It's an application of common and well-known statistical methods on
(public) data (in the field of dementia diagnosis data).

- Not at all technical - pure medical stuff ! ??

Is this the focus of CoDIT papers.
