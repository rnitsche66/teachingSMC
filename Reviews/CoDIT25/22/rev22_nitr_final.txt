Dementia Diagnosis

To the editors:

This paper investigates the relationship between demographic
factors and dementia diagnosis using National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset. Key findings include
significant associations with age groups and educational
levels, highlighting the need for public health initiatives
to address ageing populations and educational disparities.

The paper uses Chi-square tests and Cramer's V to examine
between demographic and social factors and dementia
diagnosis.

The paper is hard to read, e.g. the preprocessing of the
NHIS data is hard to understand. Especially this section is
not well structured and therefore hard to understand.


What is the scientific contribution of the paper?
What is new about this approach?

Some editorial notes:

- abbreviations are introduced and never used or introduced
  twise (e.g. VHA, MCI, ...)
  
- use brackets when referring to equations e.g. Equation (1)
   not Equation 1.

- Place the caption underneath a figure and overneath a
  table. This is mixed up in the paper.

- 'Error! Reference source not found' appears in the paper ... ?


Finally:
********
From the reviewer's point of view, this paper is not
a scientific contribution and has nothing to do with
engineering in a technical sense which is supposed to be the
scope of CoDIT.









Short Summary

also economical impact

Key Issues: *******************************************************
hands on data analysis:
1) Chi Square method and then (determine whether there is dependency)

2) Cramers V (Kind of correlation): what's the value of the dependency
/ correlation

This is not a scientific contribution and has nothing to do with
engineering in a technical sense which is supposed to be the scope of
CoDIT.

Again: unusual formating
The caption Figure 1 and Figure 2 should be under the figures, not
above. For the tables it's ok. For Figure 3 it is ok.

An Error message appears in the text from the type setting system ->
paper not carefully prepared.

Improvements / Questions ********************************************
- a lot of abbreciaitons are used before explanation (hard to read) =>
not really :) contrerily - a lot of abbreviations introduced and never
used, e.g  VHA,
and some abbreviations are explained twice, (MCI) ...
   
- What is the scientific part of the papaer?

Data (NHIS) preprocessing is hard to understand as it is in Fließtext....
Not structured some how -> is there a method behind the preprocessing ...
seems to be taylor-made - again scientific method is not available

use brackets when referring to equations e.g. Equation (1) not Equation 1.

The explanation of the Chi-square method is ok. :)


To the Editors: Does this topic really matches to the CoDIT issues?
It's an application of common and well-known statistical methods on
(public) data (in the field of dementia diagnosis data).

- Not at all technical - pure medical stuff ! ??

Is this the focus of CoDIT papers.
