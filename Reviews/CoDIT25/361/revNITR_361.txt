This paper details the creation of a wireless electrogastrography
(EGG) system designed to measure the myoelectrical activity of the
stomach using surface electrodes. The system is structured into five
main stages, facilitating the collection, processing, and transmission
of EGG data.

The system was tested on 10 healthy subjects (ages 18-23):
- Data were analyzed in the frequency domain to validate the EGG
frequency signature.
- The study highlights the relevance of EGG in diagnosing gastric
disorders like gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia.

The developed wireless EGG monitoring device demonstrates effective
collection and analysis of gastric myoelectrical activity, indicating
its potential for clinical gastroenterological diagnostics. 

The paper is well written and structured.

It's a solid paper, but lacks a significant scientific contribution.

The challenge lies in processing very weak and noisy signals.  The
main questions, which should be clarified in the paper: How does the
EGG looks for a non-healthy person?  Is the proposed system able to
distinguish between normal and abnormal EGG ?
 


Questions:

Why not using digital filters after the noisy signals are amplified in
a first stage. With this one would be much more flexible in
designing/developing and especially testing the approach/filters.

How does the EGG looks for a non-healthy person. Is the proposed system
able to distinguish between normal and abnormal EGG ?

Table I and II: physical units of the magnitude, something like (V^2/Hz) ?
