Review of

Energy-efficient scheduling problem under speed-scaling and
power-saving machine states

*****************************************************************

This paper deals of an optimization approach applied to an
energy-efficient scheduling problem of a machine in a production
process.

The approach is novel in the sense that it takes the
speed-scalability, the multi-machine states in a suitable combination
with a total energy for the optimazation objective into account.

It combines a geneteic approach with a local gradient based
optimization approach to find a near optimal solution. This approach
is very effective and efficient.

The paper has a well structured literature review and
furthermore introduces a model of a production process of a single
machine.

The paper is well structured and the appraoch is well motivated by
explaining and modelling the single machines process.  The description
of the approach is understandable and the presented results are good.

However, the Taguchi settings for the parameter settings is not so
clear, since in Fig. 5 the signal-to-noise ratio is illustrated with a
remark that 'smaller is better' and in the text, it is mentioned that
'highest ratio represents beter performance'. Isn't this a
contradiction?

Since the paper has 7 pages (paper limit is 6), maybe the literature
review part could be shortened.
