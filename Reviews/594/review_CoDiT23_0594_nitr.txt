Review of

The double inverted pendulum with real mass distribution stabilization


*****************************************************************

The model of an Acrobot is introduced and several control methods are
explained to control the system in upper position. The system dynamics
can be designed or changed to to alter the mass distribution.
This appraoch is quite interessting.
Several control design methods are introduced,


A lot of recaps in the paper. i.e. references to former or other
papers. But this is the on of the subjects of the papaer -> ok.

Gravitation vector is missing in Fig. 1

The paper has 7 pages, ...

Some Remarks:
*************

Page 3:
quartuple => quadruple

II.C: which state transformation in normal form (dim 3) with a zero
      dynamics. Which state is in the zero dynamics?? Is this
      explained in [3] ?
      
II.C.1: there a lot of references to [3] - sometimes hard to follow -
        but ok.
Strange numbering of subsection 1 ??


Page 4: Eq.(22) is a time-variant linear system, but for those systems
eigenvalues and consequently the Hurwitz Criteria doesn't guarentee
stabiltiy. Proof by Ljapunov stability is more reliable.

Page 5: From where is this controllability condition (28) derived
        from?  Is there a physical interpretation?  Since this is one
        of the core features, as one can take influence on the
        parameters by moving the variable masses, i.e. the lc1 and
        lc2.
