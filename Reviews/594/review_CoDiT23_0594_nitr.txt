Review of

The double inverted pendulum with real mass distribution stabilization


*****************************************************************

The model of an Acrobot is introduced and several control methods are
explained to control the system in upper position. The system dynamics
can be designed or changed by altering the mass distribution.  This
appraoch is quite interessting.  Several control design methods are
introduced, but not really explained nor discussed.

The paper has 7 pages, and some typos.

It is a fair paper.

Some remarks to improve the quality of the paper are written in the
section to the authors.

*****


A lot of recaps are the paper, i.e. references to former or other
papers. This is sometimes really hard to follow.

Please add the gravitation vector in Fig. 1



Addidional Remarks:
******************

Page 3:
quartuple => quadruple

Section II.C: which state transformation in normal form (dim 3) with a zero
      dynamics. Which state is in the zero dynamics?? Is this
      explained in [3] ?
      
Section II.C.1: there a lot of references to [3] - sometimes hard to follow -
        but ok.
Strange numbering of subsection 1 ??


Page 4: Eq.(22) is a time-variant linear system, but for those systems
eigenvalues and consequently the Hurwitz Criteria doesn't guarentee
stabiltiy. Proof by Ljapunov stability is more reliable.

Page 5: From where is this controllability condition (28) derived
        from?  Is there a physical interpretation?  Since this is one
        of the core features, as one can take influence on the
        parameters by moving the variable masses, i.e. the lc1 and
        lc2.
