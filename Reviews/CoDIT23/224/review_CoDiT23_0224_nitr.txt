Review of

Adoption of Big Data and AI in UAE SMEs in
Unpredictable Environment


*****************************************************************

This paper describes advantages using 'big data' and 'artificial
intelligence' (AI) technology especially for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) focussing on the United Arabic Emirates (UAE).

The paper focuses mainly on a literature review for the digital
transformation using Big Data and AI.

This review is clearly structured: starting with a theoretical
background, a good overview is given in which step of the production
development progress Big Data and AI makes sense and can help SMEs to
deal with further crisis such as a COVID-19 pandemic.

The paper was easy to read and very interesting topics in it.  Big
Data and AI can really help SMEs to improve the product development
process. It is an extension but not a replacement to the current
processes. And in some areas it really has the potential to replace
the actual processes.

However some questions still arises:
************************************

- Are the data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic really be used
as a basis for ANY other crisis, which will appear in the future?
See: 'As a result, a business model that incorporates AI could improve
operations for a company amid any economic crisis [14]' or 'The use of
big data allows organizations to improve strategic decision-making in
the face of any crisis, such as COVID-19'.
=> Those statements should be critically checked.

- In Chapter IV 'LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK', no real limitations can
  be found. But the are some limitations: AI is a kind of a black-box
  approach, can the collected data really be used as a basis of any
  future crises (is extrapolation possible or even reasonable?)

- Can we blindly really on the models build out of those big data,
  which we have no real insight and understanding of the models?
  


Remarks:
********
There are a lot of abbreveations in the text, which are mostly
explained somewhere troughout the text, but often not before or when
they appear for the first time. Maybe an abbreviation table makes sense.

Not all references listd in the reference chapter are explained or
referenced in the paper.
