Review of

Towards an ontology-based fault detection and
diagnosis framework - a semantic approach


*****************************************************************

The paper deals with an approach to fault detection in continuously
changing systems by combining several fault detection approach with
the help of semantic technologies.

The paper gives a good overview of those techniques and can serve as 
a guideline of which combination is best for which issue.

First a brief overview of ontology-based reasoning and some relevant
semantic technologies are given.

Well-structured paper, starting with the definition of methods (and
introducing the used abbreviations).

Figure 2 gives a good overview of the approach and the workflow is
well explained in Chapter II.

How does Fig. 3 fit into Fig. 2 - this is not clear, is it?

A simple example (wiring process) illustrates the functioning of the
method pretty clearly.

Regarding Fig. 5: is it possible that any cross dependencies exist? In this
example, there are only bottom-to-top dependencies.


Is such a huge framework for a bigger application maintainable?


Is this approach applicable to real-world (industrial) problems?  This
should be stated and motivated first, before the theory or approach
will be extended.

Another question which arises is whether this approach is really
scalable.  This proof must first be provided, before extending the
approach.
