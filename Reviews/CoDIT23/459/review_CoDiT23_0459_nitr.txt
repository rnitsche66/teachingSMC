Review of

Modeling, Control, Simulation and Prototyping of Tracked Mobile Robot


*****************************************************************

The paper deals with modelling, controlling and trajectory planning
for a mobile robot with sliding wheels and differential traction.

Some investigations are made in simulation and also experiment.

SolidWorks, Mathematica and Matlab/Simulink is used...

The derivation of the model for model-based control design is a bit
confusing and should be reworked to be better understandable.

A lot of remarks are directly addressed to the author to come up with
a better derivation.

The controller design method based on back-stepping is feasible for
this control task.

7 pages - paper too long


=> Solid paper ....

************



Is there really a way to export a Simulink model for system simulation
out of a Solid Works model??

The derivation of the formulas for the dynamics of the mobile robot is
sometimes hard to follow, since a lot of Parameters or states are only
loosely explained (e.g. what is \dot q or \dot p).

What is the motivation to introduce the Matrix B(q)?

What is the motivation to have the eq. of differential kinematics and
the inverse differential kinematics? What is it good for - motivation?

Page 3: D(q) is not a function of q it's just D!
- Why is u_d an input? I think the control input is \tau (see eq. (21))

Page 4:
Concerning (24), this is not a model, this are the error dynamics
which is non-linear.

Note: Lyapunov function candidate may also be negative semi-definit
(Condition 4).  Then one can use La Salle's Theorem to ensure
stability!


A block diagram of the control structure would be very helpful !
- What is the system to be controlled?
- What are the in-/outputs
- How does the control loop looks like?
- Which sensor signals does the controller need?
=> Fig. 4 can be used as a basis, and extented on the controllre module side by which eq. is used in which block?

Remarks:
*******

Figure 1 uses capital R for the index and in the text / equations lower r are used => inconsistent

- Please put a . after the formulas, if the sentence ends after the
  formula

- d, the distance between the left and right wheel is explained too
  late in the text. This parameter is used in some formulas before it
  is explained.

- Don't start a sentence with a variable - this is unusual and hard to
  read (e.g. last sentences 2nd page, left column)

- in the sentence in the abstract:
'Also, as mentioned before, SolidWorks
for the project and simulation of the robotâ€™s mechanical
components (Simscape application for multibody mechanical
systems)' the verb is missing.

- page 3 in the middle: why is there a 1) before  'Non-holonomic constraints'
- Langrangean should be Langrangian
- Some more typos are throughout the papaer - please recheck!

No SI-units in Table 1.
No SI-units in the speed trajectorie Section IV.B.

Table II: the sliding wheel length l does not appear in the dynamic model ?
On page 6 the moment of inertia is denotes with a I and no longer with J - why ?
