Review of

Simulating the dynamic behavior of heat exchange

*****************************************************************

The paper regards Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS).  It
develops a simulation model to efficientely compute the heat exchange
behaviour of those TABS.

Approach: based on transfer functions rather than FEM -> faster
 simulation But this is clear, the questions which accuracy is
 requiered for this purpose?

First a FEM model (in COMSOL, multiphysik simulation) is
introduced. The model introduction is a bit confusing. No clear
introduction, hard to follow.


- strange non-proper layout
   # too many pages (7 pages)
   # a lot of typos
   # no clear structuer - hard to read
   # Eq. (5) - (7) not explained at all
   # Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 not explained at all
   # Fig. 7, pseudo-random binary signal (SPAB): without units...
   # Fig. 8, no units - interpretation of the results unclear ....
   # Languages mixed up - english and french:
      'Cosinus à fréquence variable sur multi expériences'


reject the paper...


Figure 1: poor picture, not all states explained in the text appears
in the figure, therefore it is hard to understand.


Remarks:
********
- 7 pages: paper too long
